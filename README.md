# Heart-Attack Analysis & Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a project on **Heart-Attack Analysis & Prediction** using supervised machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify and predict whether a patient is prone to heart failure based on various attributes. This is a binary classification problem involving multiple numerical and categorical features.

## About the Disease

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually, which is about 31% of all deaths. Early detection and management of cardiovascular diseases are crucial, especially for individuals at risk, including those with hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or pre-existing heart conditions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes 11 features that are critical in predicting the risk of heart disease. These features encompass a mix of numerical and categorical data, which are processed and analyzed to build an effective predictive model.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Building**: Training various supervised machine learning models to predict heart failure.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the model using a web application to make predictions on new data.

## How to Run

You can run the project using Google Colab or deploy the web application to make predictions.

### Google Colab

You can access and run the project in Google Colab using the following link:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the data for modeling by executing the preprocessing scripts.
2. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models using the prepared data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
